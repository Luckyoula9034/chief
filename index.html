    <h3>Copacabana Beach brazil</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class=>
        <h3>history</h3>
        <hr>
        The district was originally called Sacopenapã (translated from the Tupi language, it means "the way of the socós", the socós being a kind of bird) until the mid-18th century. It was renamed after the construction of a chapel holding a replica of the Virgen de Copacabana, the patron saint of Bolivia.[2] The name may be derived from the Aymara kota kahuana, meaning "view of the lake." The social scientist Mario Montaño Aragón found in the "archives of Indias" in Sevilla, Spain, a different history: "Kotakawana" is the god of fertility in ancient Andean mythology, the equivalent to the classical Greek goddess Aphrodite or the Roman Venus. This god is androgynous and lives in the Titicaca, and his court consists of creatures (male and female) that are represented in colonial sculptures and in Catholic churches. They were called "Umantuus", known as mermaids in Western culture

            Copacabana begins at Princesa Isabel Avenue and ends at Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Beyond Copacabana, there are two small beaches: one, inside Fort Copacabana and the other, right after it: Diabo ("Devil") Beach. Arpoador beach, where surfers go after its perfect waves, comes next, followed by the famous borough of Ipanema. The area was one of the four "Olympic Zones" during the 2016 Summer Olympics. According to Riotur, the Tourism Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro, there are 63 hotels and 10 hostels in Copacabana.

        <h3>Copacabana beach</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Copacabana beach, located at the Atlantic shore, stretches from Posto Dois (lifeguard watchtower Two) to Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Leme is at Posto Um (lifeguard watchtower One). There are historic forts at both ends of Copacabana beach; Fort Copacabana, built in 1914, is at the south end by Posto Seis and Fort Duque de Caxias, built in 1779, at the north end. One curiosity is that the lifeguard watchtower of Posto Seis never existed.[4] Hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs and residential buildings dot the promenade facing Avenida Atlântica. On Sundays and holidays, one side of Avenida Atlântica is closed to cars, giving residents and tourists more space for activities along the beach.

            Copacabana Beach plays host to millions of revellers during the annual New Year's Eve celebrations, and in most years, has been the official venue of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.</p>

    <h3>Mombasa Beach Kenya</h3>
    <hr>
    <P style="color: yellowgreen">
        <h3>history</h3>
        <hr>
       The founding of Mombasa is associated with two rulers: Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita. According to legend, Mwana Mkisi is the original ancestor of Mombasa's oldest lineages within Thenashara Taifa (or Twelve Nations). Families associated with the Twelve Nations are still considered the original inhabitants of the city. Mwana Mkisi was a queen from the pre-Islamic era, who founded Kongowea, the original urban settlement on Mombasa Island. Importantly, both of these names have linguistic and spiritual connections with Central Africa. "Mkisi" is considered the personification of "ukisi" which means "the holy" in kiKongo. "Kongowea" can similarly be interpreted as the Swahili locative of "kongo" which denotes the essence of civilizational order in central Africa. These legends can be read as an acknowledgment of the Bantu-speaking origins of the Swahili people. Shehe Mvita superseded the dynasty of Mwana Mkisi and established the first permanent stone mosque on Mombasa Island. Mombasa's oldest extant stone mosque, Mnara, was built c. 1300. Shehe Mvita is remembered as a Muslim of great learning and so is connected more directly with the present ideals of Swahili culture that people identify with Mombasa. The ancient history associated with Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita and the founding of an urban settlement on Mombasa Island is still linked to present-day peoples living in Mombasa. The Thenashara Taifa (or Twelve Nations) Swahili lineages recount this ancient history today and are the keepers of local Swahili traditions.[5]

        <h3>Nyali beach</h3>
        <hr>
        Nyali is renowned for its tourist potential, thanks to its calm water, its accommodation facilities and its coast bordered with white sand beaches protected by a coral reef, loved by divers. This is a part of the Mombasa Marine Reserve, managed by Kenya Wildlife Service.

        Nyali also shelters many luxury hotels on almost all the seaside (Nyali Beach Resort, Voyager Hotel, Reef Hotel, Mombasa Beach Hotel), alterning with more affordable hotels (Backpackers Hotel) and with numerous places of entertainment and activities for the tourists (beach volley, windsurfing, scuba diving, kite surf, jet skiing, sailing...).

    <h3>Spain beaches</h3>
    <hr>
    <p >
        <h3>history</h3>
        <hr>
        The history of Spain dates back to the Middle Ages. In 1516, Habsburg Spain unified a number of disparate predecessor kingdoms; its modern form of a constitutional monarchy was introduced in 1813, and the current democratic constitution dates to 1978.

After the completion of the Reconquista, the Crown of Castile began to explore across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492, expanding into the New World and marking the beginning of the Golden Age under the Spanish Empire. The kingdoms of Spain were united under Habsburg rule in 1516, that unified the Crown of Castile, the Crown of Aragon and smaller kingdoms under the same rule. Until the 1650s, Habsburg Spain was among the most powerful states in the world.

During this period, Spain was involved in all major European wars, including the Italian Wars, the Eighty Years' War, the Thirty Years' War, and the Franco-Spanish War. In the later 17th century, however, Spanish power began to decline, and after the death of the last Habsburg ruler, the War of the Spanish Succession ended with the relegation of Spain, now under Bourbon rule, to the status of a second-rate power with a reduced influence in European affairs. The so-called Bourbon Reforms attempted the renewal of state institutions, with some success, but as the century ended, instability set in with the French Revolution and the Peninsular War, so that Spain never regained its former strength.

    <h3>La Concha Beach, San Sebastian, Spain</h3>
    
    <hr>
    <p>
        Not every extraordinary beach needs to be an isolated oasis. Take for instance, La Concha in the town of San Sebastian. Its setting is so breathtaking in part because it is flanked by a striking cityscape made even more dramatic by San Sebastian's hilly topography.

La Concha's sprawling 130-foot-wide crescent of sand curves nearly 4,500 feet around the sparkling Bay of La Concha, and is widely considered one of the world's top urban beaches. Its popularity means La Concha is perpetually crowded, though this party atmosphere can be part of its allure for some travelers.

To add to La Concha's striking setting, in the midst of the bay juts Santa Clara Island, a jagged and dramatic formation. When you've had enough sun and sea, stumble off the beach and into some of San Sebastian's main sites, including the bustling La Concha promenade, which surrounds the beach, or visit the nearby town hall and old town historic center.

<h3>about us</h3>

Chief Tour guide began life in 2015, when two friends with many years of experience in the travel business, decided that existing travel websites simply did not go far enough in helping travellers find the specific accommodations they really wanted.

The big travel websites can only help with basic accommodation searches. When it comes to more specific requirements, such as a pet-friendly, centrally-located, 4-star hotel with a spa within walking distance of a pet-friendly restaurant OR a disabled-friendly hotels with free parking and Wi-Fi, the big providers consistently disappoint leaving the traveller with few options. In addition, all the key information that a traveller needs about a destination to help plan the perfect trip is often not found in one single place and requires tireless research across multiple websites.
