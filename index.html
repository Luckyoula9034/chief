<h3>about us</h3>

Chief Tour guide began life in 2015, when two friends with many years of experience in the travel business, decided that existing travel websites simply did not go far enough in helping travellers find the specific accommodations they really wanted.

The big travel websites can only help with basic accommodation searches. When it comes to more specific requirements, such as a pet-friendly, centrally-located, 4-star hotel with a spa within walking distance of a pet-friendly restaurant OR a disabled-friendly hotels with free parking and Wi-Fi, the big providers consistently disappoint leaving the traveller with few options. In addition, all the key information that a traveller needs about a destination to help plan the perfect trip is often not found in one single place and requires tireless research across multiple websites.
